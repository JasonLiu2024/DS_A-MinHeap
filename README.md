# About:
In this project, I implement a min-heap, which is an implementation for priority queue, given a framework. This assignment was due on September 27th, 2022.

# Files:
1. MinHeap.java (and codeIWrote.java)

In this file, i worked on the swap(), insert(), extractMin(), removeAtIndex(), parentIndex(), leftChildIndex(), rightChildIndex(), bubbleDown(), bubbleUp(). 'Bubble' refers to recursively iterating through the min-heap, moving entries to maintain the min-heap property.

2. HeapSort.java

This implementation of heap sort tests the validity of the min-heap.

3. PQEntry.java

The interface file for the PQEntry (i.e. priority queue entry)

4. PriorityQueue.java

The interface file implementing a priority queue, where entry with smaller value has greater priority.
